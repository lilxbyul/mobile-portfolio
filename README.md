In the file main.js for pizza.html, I took the document.body.ScrollTop and document.querySelectorAll out of the loop as it too expensive to run every time the loop is entered.  In respect to those two changes in code, page rendered and refreshed quicker.

As for the index.html, I got a 96/100 from Pagespeed Insights.
